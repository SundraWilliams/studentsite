      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        We know that when people are given the space and time where they can be nurtured and cared for, nothing, but good unfurls from it. We believe in massage and the healing arts as a way to look after the mind, body, and spirit of our community. We are thankful for each person that walks through our door because the fact that you are taking the time to tend to yourself, we know that you will be better prepared to care for those around you. You are in good hands.

        Red Earth is a locally owned massage studio established as an act of love and kuleana to the islands and its people. We believe it is not only our responsibility, but also our privledge to provide a space and time for people to care for themselves. Red Earth was born at the beginning of 2013 in conjunction with Creative Fitness, a pilates studio located at Kilohana Square on Kapahulu. Thanks to an ever growing and truly amazing clientele, at the start of July, we were able to expand into a slightly larger facility located at Eaton Square on the Ala Moana side of Waikiki. Red Earth had been a dream years before it was a reality. From the bottom of our hearts, we cannot thank you all enough for joining and supporting us in its constant growth. There is so much more we aim to give back; so much more in store.
        With humbled hearts, mahalo piha and aloha.
